Anti-Apoptotic Signalling Protein</span><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
Bcl-2 proteins are a family of homo- or hetero-dimeric signalling
proteins that are involved in apoptosis regulation. The&nbsp; Bcl-2
(B-cell lymphoma 2) protein itself is an important therapeutic drug
target for cancer, more specifically: CLL (chronic lymphocytic
leukemia).&nbsp; Mutations in the BCL2 gene are known to be the cause
of various cancers, cancer resistance, and autoimmune diseases.<br>
<br>
Bcl-2 acts as an anti-apoptotic (pro-survival) signal by binding
(heterodimerizing) and inhibiting pro-apoptotic proteins including Bax
and Bak (among numerous other binding partners). Bax and Bak themselves
are two pro-apoptotic Bcl2-family (Bcl-2-like) proteins and are able to
dimerize with Bcl-2 via Bcl-2-homology (BH) domains.<br>
<br>
Shown below is a structure of Bcl-2 bound to a segment of the BH3
domain of Bax (PDB 2XA0).<br>

with a segment of the Bax BH3 domain (green). Note how the BH3 peptide
engages the groove of Bcl-2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Venetoclax is a selective inhibitor of Bcl-2 and this drug is notable
in the field of fragment-based drug discovery in that it was the second
approved drug to be developed using this approach.<br>
The figure below shows that venetoclax engages the same pocket that is
normally the binding site for BH3 domains on Bcl-2 binding partners. <br>
