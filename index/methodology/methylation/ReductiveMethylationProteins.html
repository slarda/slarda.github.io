Reductive methylation (a type of reductive amination), is a chemical
reaction whereby an aldehyde or ketone are converted to an amine via an
imine intermediate. It is an important reaction in the manufacture of
pharmaceuticals and other products.<br>
<br>
A general reaction scheme for reductive methylation is shown below,
whereby a primary amine is mono-methylated to yield a secondary
methylamine. <br>

cyanoborohydride as the reducing agent. <br>
<br>
<br>
Note that this reaction can be conducted under aqueous conditions using
the appropriate reducing agent and is therefore an excellent
bioconjugation reaction. The reaction is high-yielding and simple to
perform at small scale making it suitable for functionally modifying
proteins and other biomacromolecules. <br>
Interestingly, reductive methylation will also work on secondary
amines, thereby generating the corresponding tertiary amine - as such
reductively methylated proteins tend to have all amino groups
(N-terminal amines and lysine side chain amino groups) fully
dimethylated.<br>
<br>
For example, reductive methylation of hen egg white lysozyme with <sup>13</sup>C
formaldehyde can be used to spectroscopically fingerprint each lysine
and N-terminal amino group by NMR (<sup>13</sup>C HSQC), thereby
allowing one to probe conformational changes in response to pH changes,
temperature, pressure, or functional states (i.e. salt-bridge).<br>

When it comes to bioconjugation or any type of covalent modification
technique applied to proteins, the biochemist should always consider
how the chemical modification affects the structure and/or function of
the modified protein. <br>
Because many biophysical techniques require labeling (fluorophore), or
tethering onto a chip or surface (SPR, AFM), it is prudent to be aware
of how small chemical modifications can have profound impacts on
protein conformation, dynamics and function (more on this in a separate
post). </span><span class="docsum-journal-citation full-journal-citation">Some
fluorophores tend to be quite large and hydrophobic and will undoutedly
affect conformation, stability, or function if the protein is
chemically modified to a high degree. </span><span class="docsum-journal-citation full-journal-citation">The
dynamic considerations of chemical modification are almost always
overlooked even though they are often quite important for function. <br>
<br>
Reductive methylation, however, is one of the most well-tolerated
functional modifications that can be performed on proteins.
Mono-methylation results in a significant increase in the pKa of each
amino group but further modification to the dimethylated protein
returns the pKa to a level close to the original pKa of the unmodified
amine. Some differences in function and structure are still observed
even for such a well-tolerated chemical labeling approach. <br>
<br>
Below is a comparison of the backbone structures for reductively
methylated and native hen egg white lysozyme. The backbone RMSD is
0.35, indicating that methylation has minimally perturbed the protein. <br>
