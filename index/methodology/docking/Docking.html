<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Docking Venetoclax (2nd
approved drug from fragment-based discovery)</span><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
This post picks up from an earlier introduction to the anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 protein and an FDA approved drug (venetoclax), a selective
inhibitor of Bcl-2. In brief, we summarized why Bcl-2 is an attractive
target for therapeutic development and highlighted how venetoclax binds
to a large pocket on the protein. <br>
<br>
Here we will (re)dock and cross-dock the ligand from a co-crystal structure to Bcl-2
using Autodock Vina<sup>1</sup>. <br>
A related software package<sup>2</sup>
(smina) is built upon the original Autodock Vina and has some
additional scoring and minimization features, which will be covered in
a later post. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
While there are limitations to the usefulness of re-docking<sup>3</sup>,
it is a relatively simple exercise to do when first starting with a new
model and it can sometimes reveal interesting information about the
system (and serves as a quick sanity check) prior to cross-docking or
virtual screening. Cross-docking - whereby you extract the ligand from
a co-crystal structure and dock to a different, but related structure
is typically a better challenge to evaluate docking robustness. Minor
conformational differences (especially in sidechain packing or
rotamers) are not uncommon and can have a large impact on the docking
poses. <br>
<br>
See below for
some opinionated notes on model validation. <br>

ligand - BH3 peptide (green). PDB: 6O0P and 2XA0, respectively.<br>
<br>
We see above that the small molecule inhibitor, venetoclax, binds
to a long trench or groove in the structure of Bcl-2. This is the same
pocket that facilitates binding of Bcl-2 to its protein binding
partners (via homo- or hetero-dimerization). <br>

Autodock Vina is an open source molecular docking program developed at
the Scripps Research Institute by Dr. Oleg Trott<sup>1</sup>.
There are many docking programs (both free and commercial) available
including: Glide, MOE, GOLD, rDock, DOCK, and many more. With over 60+
docking programs available, everyone has their favorite and numerous
reviews comparing the different packages have been published<sup>4,5</sup>.
<br>
<br>
Using Autodock Vina, re-docking venetoclax to the Bcl-2 G101A mutant
construct (PDB: 6O0P) yields a series of possible binding modes (cyan),
the first of which very closely resembles the binding pose of the
co-crystallized ligand (magenta). <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Cross-docking the venetoclax ligand (from PDB: 6O0P) to a related
inhibitor-bound structure of WT Bcl-2 (4IEH) yields docking poses that
deviate more from the true binding mode than do the re-docked
poses.&nbsp; However, overall the lowest energy pose from the
cross-docking still closely resembles the true binding mode found in
the co-crystal (see pose mid-animation). <br>

protein surfaces differ as these correspond to conformational
differences (mostly side chain) between the two related protein
structures.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Model
validation: </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">This is a critical part of any
virtual screening / docking workflow. The takeaway is that the model
should have predictive power and should therefore always be validated
against experimental data. Model preparation, minimization, and
optimization can be done exhaustively (and by following stringent
protocols, best practices, etc) only to find out that has poor
predictive power. A well-ordered (highly structured) binding pocket
lacking significant conformational exchange might be a far superior
model (in terms of predictive power) than even the most exhaustively
"prepared" model of a highly dynamic, disordered pocket. </span><br>
<br style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">A note on
dynamics:</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">It is a common error to assume a
static picture of proteins and their putative binding pockets - an
error which can in part be attributed by the fact that x-ray structures
present us with a static view of the target (unless we consciously take
this into account via B-factor, NMR restraints (NOE), compare to other
related structures, simulate dynamics via MD, etc). All too often can a
lack of consideration for the dynamic nature of proteins result in
misleading rational design efforts!</span><br>
